#### This is project-2 from my machine learning with tensorflow - Nanodegree

### Project Overview

Project is to develop a deep neural network with TensorFlow that recognizes the type of a flower using 102 different types of flowers, where there are ~20 images per flower to train on.

#### the project consists of two parts:

Part1: Build and train a custom image classifier using a pre-trained network "MobileNet", The new neural network was trained on Oxford Flowers 102 dataset and then saved with the .h5 extension in this repository.

Part2: Convert and developed the saved Keras model from part1 into a command-line application.
