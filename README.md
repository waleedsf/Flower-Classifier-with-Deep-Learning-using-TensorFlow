# flowerSpecies-Classifier
AI algorithms will be incorporated into more and more everyday applications. For example, we might want to include an image classifier in a smart phone app. To do this, we would use a deep learning model trained on hundreds of thousands of images as part of the overall application architecture. A large part of software development in the future will be using these types of models as common parts of applications.
In this project, I'll train an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. You can imagine using something like this in a phone app that tells you the name of the flower your camera is looking at. In practice I would train this classifier, then export it for use in our application.


# Project consists of two parts:

Part 1: Build and train a custom image classifier using a pre-trained network "MobileNet", The new neural network was trained on Oxford Flowers 102 dataset and then saved with the .h5 extension in this repository.

Part 2: Convert and developed the saved Keras model from part1 into a command-line application.
